\section{Conclusion}
HD video playback on mobile devices needs to be improved. Battery power expenditure is fast at HD video playback and many low end devices suffer from low frame rate.

Based on the fact that users are only interested in part of a video scene at some cases, we designed a software approach named selective decoding to reduce the battery power consumption and increase the frame rate for HD video playback on mobile devices.

Selective decoding is based on analyzing and  tracing various intra- and inter-frame dependency relationships among macroblocks. By doing so, we compute a selective mask which indicates the macroblocks needed to present a clear scene in a user requested ROI. The selective mask  instructs a modified decoder to decode the macroblocks  selectively. The ROI can be captured using a multi-touch gesture interface, which is common in todayâ€Ÿs mobile devices.
